			Solid Food Fun</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Oliver has started on solid foods &mdash; a little early, as it turns out, due to him being a little on the skinny side. He&rsquo;s only tried sweet potatoes so far, but he is loving it!</p>

<p>I bought a sweet potato the other day, and Rebecca steamed it and then pureed it in the Vita-Mix with some water. I started out putting a little bit on my finger and touching it to his lip. When he opened his mouth, I put it inside his mouth. He&rsquo;s gotten to the point where he&rsquo;s pulling my hand toward his mouth to get more. And he&rsquo;s started eating it off a spoon too. He dives his little mouth toward the spoon when he&rsquo;s ready for more. He is still figuring out what to do with his tongue &mdash; sometimes he pushes his tongue out, and sometimes he doesn&rsquo;t &mdash; but he typically eats a few dollops of sweet potatoes after most of his bottles these days.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a picture:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rdmey/10744628153/" title="A18A0358 by rdmey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3807/10744628153_415fd352d2.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="A18A0358"></a></p>

<p>I also bought an avocado at the store, and it&rsquo;s almost ripe. Rebecca is probably going to prepare that for him later today or tomorrow. Then we&rsquo;ll be able to switch between the two. She also said she&rsquo;d puree some peas for him, so that will be another option. The pediatrician advised us to stick to vegetables right now, so that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re doing.</p>

			Sleep Changes</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Oliver had always been a really good sleeper &mdash; until the last time Rebecca went out of town. He got a GI bug and was having trouble sleeping. I didn&rsquo;t know at first that he was a little sick, so I was really frustrated trying to get him to go to sleep and stay asleep. And I was pretty exhausted by the time she got home.</p>

<p>When Rebecca got home, she helped a lot, but we were still having trouble putting him down to sleep &mdash; although once he recovered from the GI bug, he would typically stay asleep. I had been nursing him down, which made it hard for Rebecca to put him down instead of me. So I stopped nursing him down, and then Rebecca could put him down and I couldn&rsquo;t. So I started nursing him down again, because I&rsquo;m his primary care provider right now and that just made more sense. But then of course Rebecca couldn&rsquo;t put him down again.</p>

<p>Clearly, we needed to figure out a way that we could both put him down. So I called a sleep coach who had been recommended on one of my parenting groups. She was helpful to get us to a new place where either one of us can put him down. She also advised us on how long he should be awake in between naps (an hour and a half, as opposed to the two and a half hours that I had read was appropriate). It turns out, he does show sleepy cues (eye rubbing fussiness, etc.) after around an hour and a half. So that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve been sticking to these days.</p>

<p>Things are going much better now, although there are certainly transitions yet to come that I&rsquo;m sure will be challenging &mdash; the biggest ones are getting him out of his rock-n-play sleeper and into his crib, and transitioning him away from the &ldquo;swaddle strap&rdquo; we&rsquo;ve been using to keep his startle reflex from waking him up. But for right now, we are in a good place with sleep yet again. Last night, a friend came over from around 6:00 to 8:30 and took care of Oliver so we could go out for dinner and dessert/drinks. He was sleepy before we got home, so she did the whole bedtime routine with him, and when we got home, he was already down. It was a dream come true for me! And he slept the whole night (11 hours), just like he has been doing. We have our good sleeper back!</p>

			Skinny Boy!</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Oliver had his four-month pediatrician appointment yesterday! The doctor said he looks great &mdash; except that he is a little skinny. He dropped from the 25th percentile for weight at two months to the 5th percentile for weight at four months. We talked about various strategies for helping him gain weight &mdash; giving him an ounce more at each feeding, feeding him a 50/50 ratio of breast milk to formula (instead of 60/40 like we had been doing), and even introducing solids a little early. We&rsquo;ve already gotten started on these things, and hope that little Oliver bulks up a bit by his six-month well visit. His height is at the 45th percentile and his head circumference is at the 35th percentile, both of which are just fine based on where he&rsquo;s been in the past.</p>

			Oliver Starts Child Care</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I&rsquo;m getting ready to head back to work, so Oliver is slowly transitioning into child care. We found a really great child care center that&rsquo;s very close to my work, so I can drop him off on my way to work, pick him up on my way home from work, and even visit in the middle of the day if I want to.</p>

<p>Oliver and I toured the whole center a while back, and then we visited both infant rooms together with Rebecca, and then he and I visited his infant room and spent some time with his primary child care provider. Tomorrow, Oliver will go to child care all on his own in the morning, from around 9:30 to around 1:30, so he can start getting used to being there without me. We&rsquo;ll do the same thing the following Tuesday, and then he&rsquo;ll go full days on Tuesday and Wednesday the following week when I start back to work. The next week (Thanksgiving week), he&rsquo;ll go full days on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, which will be his regular child care schedule.</p>

<p>I really hope tomorrow goes well! I&rsquo;m most worried about him learning to sleep at child care. At home, he&rsquo;s still in his rock-n-play sleeper (an inclined rocking bassinet). At child care, he&rsquo;ll be in a crib. At home, he wears a sleep sack and a swaddle strap for naps and nights, to keep his arms from flailing. At child care, he&rsquo;ll just be in a sleep sack. I&rsquo;m glad that his room has a separate alcove where all the cribs are, and the lights are turned low in that part of the room, and they have a sound machine going all the time. I hope those things make it a bit easier for him to learn how to sleep there.</p>

			Just Oliver and Mommy</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Rebecca had to travel to her corporate headquarters recently &mdash; for nine days &mdash; so it was just Oliver and Mommy that whole time. In addition to our typical daytime activities, I planned lots of lunches and dinners with friends, so we&rsquo;d stay busy while Rebecca was away. All of that planning paid off &mdash; our week together went great!</p>

<p>Oliver was a great sleeper while Rebecca was away. Well, he&rsquo;s always a great sleeper, and thankfully that continued while she was away. The first morning we were on our own together, he woke up in the morning, ate, and then went back to sleep for three hours. While he slept, I was able to do all kinds of things, including showering and eating breakfast. I just about ran out of things to do before he finally woke up.</p>

<p>The shortest overnight sleeping stretch Oliver had the whole time Rebecca was away was 7 hours. And usually he slept from sometime between 9:30 and 11:00 at night until between 7:00 and 7:45 the next morning.</p>

<p>Rebecca really missed Oliver while she was away, so I took cute pictures of him and texted them to her. She really liked that. We also did a google hangout one night. I put Oliver on his play mat and suspended the iPad above him where I usually have a mirror suspended. I accidentally dropped the iPad on him at one point, but it could have been worse. He was definitely surprised and upset, but he recovered quickly.</p>

		<p>We saw the pediatrician again today, and Oliver grew two whole inches in just one month! He&rsquo;s now 23-&frac12; inches long. That means he&rsquo;s at the 60th percentile for height (he was at the 25th percentile last month). His weight is holding steady at the 25th percentile (10 pounds 14 ounces at this visit). His head circumference increased just a little bit, to the 30th percentile (from the 25th percentile at the last visit). So he&rsquo;s a tall, lean baby boy!</p>

			Labor Day Weekend Family Fun!</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>On Labor Day weekend, Oliver&rsquo;s Aunt Morgan, Uncle Albert, and Uncle Garrett all came for a visit. Oliver had a great time with all of them. Aunt Morgan put him to sleep a few times, Uncle Albert giggled at him, and Uncle Garrett entertained him by crinkling parchment paper.</p>

<p>On Sunday, the crew all went to A Southern Season, a board game store, and the Asian market. I wanted to take a shower, and if I had gone we would have needed to take two cars. So I stayed behind and got things done around the house, ran some errands, and showered. I was without my baby for nearly three hours, and I was so glad to see him again when he returned! Rebecca said he was a total angel the entire time.</p>

<p>Here are some pics of Oliver hanging out with his aunt and uncles:</p>

			Oliver&#8217;s New York Grandparents Visit</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Oliver&rsquo;s New York grandparents &mdash; Rebecca&rsquo;s parents &mdash; came for a week-long visit a few weeks ago. Oliver got lots of love and cuddles from his grandma and grandpa. We all spent time on the porch together (under the FANS &mdash; one of Oliver&rsquo;s favorite things in the whole world!). They also took Oliver on some walks around the neighborhood.</p>

<p>We all went out to Elmo&rsquo;s for breakfast one day, to Monuts for breakfast another day, and to Nana Taco for lunch another day. Oliver&rsquo;s grandma took Rebecca&rsquo;s place at a baby massage class one afternoon; unfortunately, Oliver slept through most of it and then woke up hungry, so we practiced on the plastic baby mannequins instead of on Oliver.</p>

<p>Oliver also got to spend time with his grandma and grandpa when they babysat him for a few hours one morning while we checked out child care options for when I return to work in November. They also babysat Oliver one evening so Rebecca and I could go out for a nice dinner. They said he was a very sweet boy both times.</p>
