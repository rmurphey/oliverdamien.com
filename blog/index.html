			Skinny Boy!</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Oliver had his four-month pediatrician appointment yesterday! The doctor said he looks great &mdash; except that he is a little skinny. He dropped from the 25th percentile for weight at two months to the 5th percentile for weight at four months. We talked about various strategies for helping him gain weight &mdash; giving him an ounce more at each feeding, feeding him a 50/50 ratio of breast milk to formula (instead of 60/40 like we had been doing), and even introducing solids a little early. We&rsquo;ve already gotten started on these things, and hope that little Oliver bulks up a bit by his six-month well visit. His height is at the 45th percentile and his head circumference is at the 35th percentile, both of which are just fine based on where he&rsquo;s been in the past.</p>

			Oliver Starts Child Care</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I&rsquo;m getting ready to head back to work, so Oliver is slowly transitioning into child care. We found a really great child care center that&rsquo;s very close to my work, so I can drop him off on my way to work, pick him up on my way home from work, and even visit in the middle of the day if I want to.</p>

<p>Oliver and I toured the whole center a while back, and then we visited both infant rooms together with Rebecca, and then he and I visited his infant room and spent some time with his primary child care provider. Tomorrow, Oliver will go to child care all on his own in the morning, from around 9:30 to around 1:30, so he can start getting used to being there without me. We&rsquo;ll do the same thing the following Tuesday, and then he&rsquo;ll go full days on Tuesday and Wednesday the following week when I start back to work. The next week (Thanksgiving week), he&rsquo;ll go full days on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, which will be his regular child care schedule.</p>

<p>I really hope tomorrow goes well! I&rsquo;m most worried about him learning to sleep at child care. At home, he&rsquo;s still in his rock-n-play sleeper (an inclined rocking bassinet). At child care, he&rsquo;ll be in a crib. At home, he wears a sleep sack and a swaddle strap for naps and nights, to keep his arms from flailing. At child care, he&rsquo;ll just be in a sleep sack. I&rsquo;m glad that his room has a separate alcove where all the cribs are, and the lights are turned low in that part of the room, and they have a sound machine going all the time. I hope those things make it a bit easier for him to learn how to sleep there.</p>

			Just Oliver and Mommy</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Rebecca had to travel to her corporate headquarters recently &mdash; for nine days &mdash; so it was just Oliver and Mommy that whole time. In addition to our typical daytime activities, I planned lots of lunches and dinners with friends, so we&rsquo;d stay busy while Rebecca was away. All of that planning paid off &mdash; our week together went great!</p>

<p>Oliver was a great sleeper while Rebecca was away. Well, he&rsquo;s always a great sleeper, and thankfully that continued while she was away. The first morning we were on our own together, he woke up in the morning, ate, and then went back to sleep for three hours. While he slept, I was able to do all kinds of things, including showering and eating breakfast. I just about ran out of things to do before he finally woke up.</p>

<p>The shortest overnight sleeping stretch Oliver had the whole time Rebecca was away was 7 hours. And usually he slept from sometime between 9:30 and 11:00 at night until between 7:00 and 7:45 the next morning.</p>

<p>Rebecca really missed Oliver while she was away, so I took cute pictures of him and texted them to her. She really liked that. We also did a google hangout one night. I put Oliver on his play mat and suspended the iPad above him where I usually have a mirror suspended. I accidentally dropped the iPad on him at one point, but it could have been worse. He was definitely surprised and upset, but he recovered quickly.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>We saw the pediatrician again today, and Oliver grew two whole inches in just one month! He&rsquo;s now 23-&frac12; inches long. That means he&rsquo;s at the 60th percentile for height (he was at the 25th percentile last month). His weight is holding steady at the 25th percentile (10 pounds 14 ounces at this visit). His head circumference increased just a little bit, to the 30th percentile (from the 25th percentile at the last visit). So he&rsquo;s a tall, lean baby boy!</p>

			Labor Day Weekend Family Fun!</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>On Labor Day weekend, Oliver&rsquo;s Aunt Morgan, Uncle Albert, and Uncle Garrett all came for a visit. Oliver had a great time with all of them. Aunt Morgan put him to sleep a few times, Uncle Albert giggled at him, and Uncle Garrett entertained him by crinkling parchment paper.</p>

<p>On Sunday, the crew all went to A Southern Season, a board game store, and the Asian market. I wanted to take a shower, and if I had gone we would have needed to take two cars. So I stayed behind and got things done around the house, ran some errands, and showered. I was without my baby for nearly three hours, and I was so glad to see him again when he returned! Rebecca said he was a total angel the entire time.</p>

<p>Here are some pics of Oliver hanging out with his aunt and uncles:</p>

			Oliver&#8217;s New York Grandparents Visit</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Oliver&rsquo;s New York grandparents &mdash; Rebecca&rsquo;s parents &mdash; came for a week-long visit a few weeks ago. Oliver got lots of love and cuddles from his grandma and grandpa. We all spent time on the porch together (under the FANS &mdash; one of Oliver&rsquo;s favorite things in the whole world!). They also took Oliver on some walks around the neighborhood.</p>

<p>We all went out to Elmo&rsquo;s for breakfast one day, to Monuts for breakfast another day, and to Nana Taco for lunch another day. Oliver&rsquo;s grandma took Rebecca&rsquo;s place at a baby massage class one afternoon; unfortunately, Oliver slept through most of it and then woke up hungry, so we practiced on the plastic baby mannequins instead of on Oliver.</p>

<p>Oliver also got to spend time with his grandma and grandpa when they babysat him for a few hours one morning while we checked out child care options for when I return to work in November. They also babysat Oliver one evening so Rebecca and I could go out for a nice dinner. They said he was a very sweet boy both times.</p>

			Oliver Likes His Legs</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Oliver&rsquo;s latest past-time is to &ldquo;stand&rdquo; on my lap with support. His legs feel sooo strong when he does this. His whole body tenses up with the effort of it. He bobs his head up and down, makes whatever his latest favorite noise is, and moves his little arms all around. It&rsquo;s totally cute. Whenever he&rsquo;s even a little bit fussy, I just stand him on my lap and start telling him what a strong boy he is. He stops fussing right away and gets all focused on using those little legs of his.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll get some pictures soon and post them here.</p>

			Our Boy Can Roll Over</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Yep, it&rsquo;s true. Our boy can roll over, front to back. It&rsquo;s pretty amazing. Last night we had some friends over for dinner, and I decided to put him down on the floor for tummy time after I changed his diaper. I put him face down on the floor, with his arms bent underneath him like I normally do. He lifted his head waaay up, so he was looking straight at me where I was positioned in front of him on the floor. And then it happened. He pushed off with his right arm and wound up halfway between his side and his back (don&rsquo;t ask me how he stalled out at precisely that position). After I praised him a ton, I yelled to Rebecca and our guests, &ldquo;You guys have got to come in here!&rdquo; They came and I told them what Oliver had done. I didn&rsquo;t put him back on his tummy for some reason; I&rsquo;m not sure why. I think I was afraid it was a fluke and he wouldn&rsquo;t do it again.</p>

<p>Then this morning after a diaper change, I put him down for tummy time again. It was the same thing, only faster. He lifted his head waaay up, pushed off with his right arm, and he was on his back. I praised him a ton and put him back on his tummy. He did it again. Pretty amazing.</p>

<p>Then this afternoon after a diaper change, I decided to put him down again. He did the whole thing again, except pushed off with his left arm this time. I called Rebecca in so she could witness the awesomeness of our boy. He did it again, pushing off with his left arm again. She was impressed.</p>

<p>Next time I hope to get a video of it. But Rebecca says that maybe four times rolling over in one day is enough, so it likely will be tomorrow before I can videotape him. Bummer. I think I&rsquo;m even more excited about this than Oliver.</p>

<p>Update: here&rsquo;s a video!</p>
