			Oliver&#8217;s Florida Grandparents Visit</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>This week, my parents &mdash; Oliver&rsquo;s Florida grandparents &mdash; came for a visit. Oliver had a nice time getting lots of attention from them. He got a horsey ride and napped with Grandpa, and went on walks and cuddled with Grandma.</p>

<p>The timing of my parents&#8217; visit was especially good because Rebecca got sick on Tuesday and couldn&rsquo;t help me with Oliver much overnight for several nights. So I was very happy to see my Mom and Dad each morning!</p>

<p>My parents and I took Oliver on quite a few outings this week. We went to Babies R Us, Buy Buy Baby, Duke Gardens, Elmo&rsquo;s, A Southern Season, and Locopops, and Dad went to Pelican&rsquo;s Snoballs to get us some shaved ice. The weather was mostly nice this week, so we also went on a lot of neighborhood walks.</p>

<p>My parents also babysat Oliver on Friday night so Rebecca and I could go out to dinner. We got some quick burgers at Bull City Burger. It was nice for the two of us to have some time together &mdash; but we were definitely ready to get home to see Oliver too.</p>

			Oliver&#8217;s First Real Pediatrician Visit</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Oliver had his first real pediatrician visit today! He was seen by the doctors in the hospital where he was born when he was just a few days old, but this was his first appointment with his actual pediatrician in North Carolina.</p>

<p>The pediatrician checked Oliver out, and said he seemed very healthy. She recommended that we do a newborn screening, because she predicted that it would be difficult to get the results of the newborn screening done in the hospital where Oliver was born. We said that was fine, so poor Oliver had to have his heel stuck and then a series of circles on a piece of paper filled in with his blood. Needless to say, he did not like that at all.</p>

			The Long Trip Home</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Today was a big day &mdash; the day we got to fly home to North Carolina with Oliver. Although we really looked forward to being home, we were worried that it would be a hard trip for Oliver. He&rsquo;d be in unfamiliar surroundings, and taking off and landing might be uncomfortable for him. We needn&rsquo;t have worried. He did great. He slept most of the time (including during takeoff and landing). He was so sleepy that we had to wake him for most of his feedings. I couldn&rsquo;t get him to nurse very much at all, which was a little concerning, but I figured I&rsquo;d work with him on that when we got to North Carolina.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there&rsquo;s no direct flight from Denver to Raleigh-Durham, so we needed to book our flight through Atlanta. Let&rsquo;s just say that Atlanta is not Rebecca&rsquo;s favorite airport. It is usually very crowded and busy, with insufficient seating at the gates. To make matters worse, our flight out of Atlanta was delayed by about an hour and a half. It turns out, though, that traveling with a newborn is a good conversation-starter. We were very popular people at our gate. Lots of people wanted to hear our story (and give us their opinions on various child-rearing tactics). We were impressed that no one tried to touch Oliver or asked to hold him.</p>

<p>The flight crew on the flight from Atlanta to Raleigh-Durham were very nice, and gave us &ldquo;wings&rdquo; (one for each of us and one for Oliver). They also gave us a bottle of wine to congratulate us on adopting Oliver.</p>

<p>We arrived around midnight, and our friend Julie picked us up in our car (so the carseat was all set). We crammed all the luggage into the car, and headed home. We tried to get to bed as quickly as possible, but we had to do a little unpacking to be sure we had all the baby gear we&rsquo;d need for the night. We finally got to bed a little after 2:00 am. We were exhausted after our long day.</p>

			North Carolina Says We Can Come Home!</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Today we learned that we got clearance from North Carolina to enter the state with Oliver! Rebecca immediately got online and booked plane tickets home for us tomorrow. The court hearing for the relinquishment of the birth parents&#8217; rights is not until early next week, so we will be leaving the state &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; &mdash; if anything goes awry with rights relinquishment, we&rsquo;ll need to return to Colorado with Oliver. But we think the chances of that are low, and we really want to be home with him as soon as possible.</p>

<p>We also got together with Oliver&rsquo;s birth mom and her mom tonight. We ate dinner together, exchanged contact information, admired how great Oliver&rsquo;s birth mom looks so soon after Oliver&rsquo;s birth, and talked about how wonderful Oliver is. It was nice to spend that time together.</p>

		<p>Last night when we were getting Oliver ready for bed, we noticed that his umbilical cord was barely still attached. So I wasn&rsquo;t surprised when Rebecca changed Oliver this morning and noticed that it had fallen off. I immediately tore apart the bed looking for it. I found it, and now it&rsquo;s saved with Oliver&rsquo;s other keepsakes (like his hospital ID bands).</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Today, we mostly hung out in the hotel room with Jan and Morgan, cuddling and spending time with Oliver. During tummy time today with Aunt Morgan, Oliver managed to turn his head from one side to the other. We were all very impressed!</p>

<p>Around mid-day, Rebecca and I both headed to the nearby pedestrian mall for some much-needed haircuts, and Jan and Morgan babysat Oliver. It was strange to be away from our baby, but good to know that Jan and Morgan were watching over him.</p>

<p>We all took a short outing to Buy Buy Baby in the afternoon. We picked up a few newborn sleeper outfits, and replaced our plastic bottles with glass bottles instead. Rebecca and I had both accidentally left nearly half of a feeding in the plastic bottles we had (which are opaque, making it hard to determine when Oliver had finished his milk). We didn&rsquo;t want to do that again.</p>

<p>That night, we went out to dinner again. Melissa tried the Moby wrap &mdash; which Rebecca had really liked &mdash; and it didn&rsquo;t work as well for her. So she put Oliver in the Ergo Baby Carrier (with the infant insert) instead. It worked much better for her, and we had another successful dinner out at a nice restaurant in the nearby pedestrian mall. Oliver peacefully slept the entire time.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Today, Oliver had his two-day check-up back at the hospital. This was supposed to be at the pediatrician&rsquo;s office, but our pediatrician is back in North Carolina, so the doctor at the hospital said we could come back to the hospital for the check-up (even though they&rsquo;re not really set up for that sort of thing). We had to wait a while, but they took good care of us. Oliver only lost a little bit of weight, as expected; otherwise, he was doing great.</p>

<p>Rebecca was clearly more tired than she realized, because she had several driving mishaps on the way to and from the hospital. Once she nearly ran a red light, and twice she nearly changed lanes when there was a car or motorcycle in the way. One of the more stressful parts of the Denver trip for her was doing all the driving in a new city.</p>

<p>At dinner time, we ventured out of the hotel with Jan and Morgan and Oliver. Rebecca wore Oliver on her chest in the Moby wrap. We had intended to get some food and bring it back to the hotel room, but Oliver was fast asleep, so we ended up deciding to eat at the restaurant, with Oliver still in the Moby wrap.</p>

<p>The night before, we&rsquo;d brought Oliver into the bed with us for part of the night, and it was really nice to have him so close. It felt somehow very wrong to put our newborn baby on the floor, several feet away from us, when recently he had literally been inside his birth mom. We did some research on cosleeping, and decided we&rsquo;d try having him sleep in the bed with us for the whole night. It was so much better on so many levels &mdash; especially the part where we got to wake up next to a beautiful sleeping baby!</p>

		<p>As Oliver was born almost a week past his due date, we&rsquo;d spent a whole week in the hotel before he was born. During this time, Rebecca got more and more stressed out about how hard it was going to be to care for a newborn baby in a hotel room. After she cried for the second time that week while we were out to dinner, we decided that it would be a good idea to fly Rebecca&rsquo;s mom and sister out to Denver to help us in the early days. Both of them arrived today.</p>

<p>Oliver continued to be really agreeable, so Jan and Morgan got to spend lots of time cuddling and holding him. Rebecca, Oliver, and I didn&rsquo;t leave the hotel room the whole day &mdash; Rebecca and I were still figuring out how to manage feeding and changing Oliver &mdash; so Jan and Morgan went down to the nearby pedestrian mall and brought dinner back to the hotel room for all of us (except Oliver, of course). Melissa figured out how to eat one-handed while holding Oliver with the other hand. We&rsquo;re pretty sure we&rsquo;ll both get really good at this in the months to come.</p>

			Discharge Day</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>When we woke in the morning, Stephanie told us that the maternity floor was filling up, and she&rsquo;d need to move us to a little out-of-the-way room on the labor and delivery floor. So we packed up our things and she showed us to our new room. The day nurse didn&rsquo;t check in on us nearly as often as Stephanie had the night before &mdash; probably because we were tucked out of the way on a different floor than all the other new moms and babies. Given that we weren&rsquo;t getting nearly as much attention as we had overnight &mdash; and that the next day was a holiday &mdash; we felt strongly that we wanted to be discharged as soon as possible.</p>

<p>We had to be a little annoying to pull it off, but once Oliver got his 24-hour checkup &mdash; and we got to sit in on his circumcision and hearing test &mdash; we were able to be discharged and head back to &ldquo;hotel-home.&rdquo; The doctor at the hospital was quite reluctant to discharge us, and warned us repeatedly that the second night would be much harder than the first.</p>

<p>It turned out that the second night was about as easy as the first &mdash; and probably easier, because we had gotten to know Oliver a bit better, and because we could be much more independent in the hotel than we&rsquo;d been able to be in the hospital. Oliver continued to be a little angel. He still wasn&rsquo;t very active, but he was much more alert than his first day. Our bedroom at the hotel was small, and we didn&rsquo;t feel comfortable sleeping with him in the bed, so he spent his first night out of the hospital sleeping in a travel bassinet on the floor of the hotel bedroom closet. We finally got out of bed at 10:00 the next morning, surprised at how incredibly well-rested we were.</p>
