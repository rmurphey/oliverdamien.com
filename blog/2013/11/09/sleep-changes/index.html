	<h2 class="title">Sleep Changes</h2>
	<div class="entry-content"><p>Oliver had always been a really good sleeper &mdash; until the last time Rebecca went out of town. He got a GI bug and was having trouble sleeping. I didn&rsquo;t know at first that he was a little sick, so I was really frustrated trying to get him to go to sleep and stay asleep. And I was pretty exhausted by the time she got home.</p>

<p>When Rebecca got home, she helped a lot, but we were still having trouble putting him down to sleep &mdash; although once he recovered from the GI bug, he would typically stay asleep. I had been nursing him down, which made it hard for Rebecca to put him down instead of me. So I stopped nursing him down, and then Rebecca could put him down and I couldn&rsquo;t. So I started nursing him down again, because I&rsquo;m his primary care provider right now and that just made more sense. But then of course Rebecca couldn&rsquo;t put him down again.</p>

<p>Clearly, we needed to figure out a way that we could both put him down. So I called a sleep coach who had been recommended on one of my parenting groups. She was helpful to get us to a new place where either one of us can put him down. She also advised us on how long he should be awake in between naps (an hour and a half, as opposed to the two and a half hours that I had read was appropriate). It turns out, he does show sleepy cues (eye rubbing fussiness, etc.) after around an hour and a half. So that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve been sticking to these days.</p>

<p>Things are going much better now, although there are certainly transitions yet to come that I&rsquo;m sure will be challenging &mdash; the biggest ones are getting him out of his rock-n-play sleeper and into his crib, and transitioning him away from the &ldquo;swaddle strap&rdquo; we&rsquo;ve been using to keep his startle reflex from waking him up. But for right now, we are in a good place with sleep yet again. Last night, a friend came over from around 6:00 to 8:30 and took care of Oliver so we could go out for dinner and dessert/drinks. He was sleepy before we got home, so she did the whole bedtime routine with him, and when we got home, he was already down. It was a dream come true for me! And he slept the whole night (11 hours), just like he has been doing. We have our good sleeper back!</p>
