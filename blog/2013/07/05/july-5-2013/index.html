<div class="entry-content"><p>Today, Oliver had his two-day check-up back at the hospital. This was supposed to be at the pediatrician&rsquo;s office, but our pediatrician is back in North Carolina, so the doctor at the hospital said we could come back to the hospital for the check-up (even though they&rsquo;re not really set up for that sort of thing). We had to wait a while, but they took good care of us. Oliver only lost a little bit of weight, as expected; otherwise, he was doing great.</p>

<p>Rebecca was clearly more tired than she realized, because she had several driving mishaps on the way to and from the hospital. Once she nearly ran a red light, and twice she nearly changed lanes when there was a car or motorcycle in the way. One of the more stressful parts of the Denver trip for her was doing all the driving in a new city.</p>

<p>At dinner time, we ventured out of the hotel with Jan and Morgan and Oliver. Rebecca wore Oliver on her chest in the Moby wrap. We had intended to get some food and bring it back to the hotel room, but Oliver was fast asleep, so we ended up deciding to eat at the restaurant, with Oliver still in the Moby wrap.</p>

<p>The night before, we&rsquo;d brought Oliver into the bed with us for part of the night, and it was really nice to have him so close. It felt somehow very wrong to put our newborn baby on the floor, several feet away from us, when recently he had literally been inside his birth mom. We did some research on cosleeping, and decided we&rsquo;d try having him sleep in the bed with us for the whole night. It was so much better on so many levels &mdash; especially the part where we got to wake up next to a beautiful sleeping baby!</p>
