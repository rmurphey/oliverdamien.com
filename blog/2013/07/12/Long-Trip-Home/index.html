	<div class="entry-content"><p>Today was a big day &mdash; the day we got to fly home to North Carolina with Oliver. Although we really looked forward to being home, we were worried that it would be a hard trip for Oliver. He&rsquo;d be in unfamiliar surroundings, and taking off and landing might be uncomfortable for him. We needn&rsquo;t have worried. He did great. He slept most of the time (including during takeoff and landing). He was so sleepy that we had to wake him for most of his feedings. I couldn&rsquo;t get him to nurse very much at all, which was a little concerning, but I figured I&rsquo;d work with him on that when we got to North Carolina.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there&rsquo;s no direct flight from Denver to Raleigh-Durham, so we needed to book our flight through Atlanta. Let&rsquo;s just say that Atlanta is not Rebecca&rsquo;s favorite airport. It is usually very crowded and busy, with insufficient seating at the gates. To make matters worse, our flight out of Atlanta was delayed by about an hour and a half. It turns out, though, that traveling with a newborn is a good conversation-starter. We were very popular people at our gate. Lots of people wanted to hear our story (and give us their opinions on various child-rearing tactics). We were impressed that no one tried to touch Oliver or asked to hold him.</p>

<p>The flight crew on the flight from Atlanta to Raleigh-Durham were very nice, and gave us &ldquo;wings&rdquo; (one for each of us and one for Oliver). They also gave us a bottle of wine to congratulate us on adopting Oliver.</p>

<p>We arrived around midnight, and our friend Julie picked us up in our car (so the carseat was all set). We crammed all the luggage into the car, and headed home. We tried to get to bed as quickly as possible, but we had to do a little unpacking to be sure we had all the baby gear we&rsquo;d need for the night. We finally got to bed a little after 2:00 am. We were exhausted after our long day.</p>
