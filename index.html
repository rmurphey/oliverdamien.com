  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today was a big day &mdash; the day we got to fly home to North Carolina with Oliver. Unfortunately, there&rsquo;s no direct flight from Denver to Raleigh-Durham, so we needed to book our flight through Atlanta.</p>

<p>Oliver was a dream.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today we learned that we got clearance from North Carolina to enter the state with Oliver! Rebecca immediately got online and booked plane tickets home for us tomorrow. The court hearing for the relinquishment of the birth parents&#8217; rights is not until early next week, so we will be leaving the state &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; &mdash; if anything goes awry with rights relinquishment, we&rsquo;ll need to return to Colorado with Oliver. But we think the chances of that are low, and we really want to be home with him as soon as possible.</p>

<p>We also got together with Oliver&rsquo;s birth mom and birth grandma tonight. We ate dinner together, exchanged contact information, admired how great Oliver&rsquo;s birth mom looks so soon after Oliver&rsquo;s birth, and talked about how wonderful Oliver is. It was nice to spend that time together. Oliver&rsquo;s birth grandma bought him some cute outfits &mdash; AND a sock monkey!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today, we mostly hung out in the hotel room with Jan and Morgan, cuddling and spending time with Oliver. During tummy time today with Aunt Morgan, Oliver managed to turn his head from one side to the other. We were all very impressed!</p>

<p>Around mid-day, Rebecca and I both headed to the nearby pedestrian mall for some much-needed haircuts, and Jan and Morgan babysat Oliver. It was strange to be away from our baby, but good to know that Jan and Morgan were watching over him.</p>

<p>We took a short outing to Buy Buy Baby in the afternoon. We picked up a few newborn sleeper outfits, and replaced our plastic bottles with glass bottles instead. Rebecca and I had both accidentally left nearly half of a feeding in the plastic bottles we had (which are opaque, making it hard to determine when Oliver had finished his milk). We didn&rsquo;t want to do that again.</p>

<p>That night, we went out to dinner again. Melissa tried the Moby wrap &mdash; which Rebecca had really liked &mdash; and it didn&rsquo;t work as well for her. So she put Oliver in the Ergo Baby Carrier (with the infant insert) instead. It worked much better for her, and we had another successful dinner out at a nice restaurant in the nearby pedestrian mall. Oliver peacefully slept the entire time.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today, Oliver had his two-day check-up back at the hospital. This was supposed to be at the pediatrician&rsquo;s office, but our pediatrician is back in North Carolina, so the doctor at the hospital said we could come back to the hospital for the check-up (even though they&rsquo;re not really set up for that sort of thing). We had to wait a while, but they took good care of us. Oliver only lost a little bit of weight, as expected; otherwise, he was doing great.</p>

<p>Rebecca was clearly more tired than she realized, because she had several driving mishaps on the way to and from the hospital. Once she nearly ran a red light, and twice she nearly changed lanes when there was a car or motorcycle in the way. One of the more stressful parts of the Denver trip for her was doing all the driving in a new city.</p>

<p>At dinner time, we ventured out of the hotel with Jan and Morgan and Oliver. Rebecca wore Oliver on her chest in the Moby wrap. We had intended to get some food and bring it back to the hotel room, but Oliver was fast asleep, so we ended up deciding to eat at the restaurant, with Oliver still in the Moby wrap.</p>

<p>The night before, we&rsquo;d brought Oliver into the bed with us for part of the night, and it was really nice to have him so close. It felt somehow very wrong to put our newborn baby on the floor, several feet away from us, when recently he had literally been inside his birth mom. We did some research on cosleeping, and decided we&rsquo;d try having him sleep in the bed with us for the whole night. It was so much better on so many levels &mdash; especially the part where we got to wake up next to a beautiful sleeping baby!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As Oliver was born almost a week past his due date, we&rsquo;d spent a whole week in the hotel before he was born. During this time, Rebecca got more and more stressed out about how hard it was going to be to care for a newborn baby in a hotel room. After she cried for the second time that week while we were out to dinner, we decided that it would be a good idea to fly Rebecca&rsquo;s mom and sister out to Denver to help us in the early days. Both of them arrived today.</p>

<p>Oliver continued to be really agreeable, so Jan and Morgan got to spend lots of time cuddling and holding him. Rebecca, Oliver, and I didn&rsquo;t leave the hotel room the whole day &mdash; Rebecca and I were still figuring out how to manage feeding and changing Oliver &mdash; so Jan and Morgan went down to the nearby pedestrian mall and brought dinner back to the hotel room for all of us (except Oliver, of course). Melissa figured out how to eat one-handed while holding Oliver with the other hand. We&rsquo;re pretty sure we&rsquo;ll both get really good at this in the months to come.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When we woke in the morning, Stephanie told us that the maternity floor was filling up, and she&rsquo;d need to move us to a little out-of-the-way room on the labor and delivery floor. So we packed up our things and she showed us to our new room. The day nurse didn&rsquo;t check in on us nearly as often as Stephanie had the night before &mdash; probably because we were tucked out of the way on a different floor than all the other new mommies and babies. Given that we weren&rsquo;t getting nearly as much attention as we had overnight &mdash; and that the next day was a holiday &mdash; we felt strongly that we wanted to be discharged as soon as possible.</p>

<p>We had to be a little annoying to pull it off, but once Oliver got his 24-hour checkup &mdash; and we got to sit in on his circumcision and hearing test &mdash; we were able to be discharged and head back to &ldquo;hotel-home.&rdquo; The doctor at the hospital was quite reluctant to discharge us, and warned us that the second night would be much harder than the first.</p>

<p>It turned out that the second night was about as easy as the first &mdash; and probably easier, because we had gotten to know Oliver a bit better, and because we could be much more independent in the hotel than we&rsquo;d been able to be in the hospital. Oliver continued to be a little angel. He still wasn&rsquo;t very active, but he was much more alert than his first day. Our bedroom at the hotel was small, and we didn&rsquo;t feel comfortable sleeping with him in the bed, so he spent his first night out of the hospital sleeping in a travel bassinet on the floor of the hotel bedroom closet. We finally got out of bed at 10:00 the next morning, surprised at how incredibly well-rested we were.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Oliver Damien Murphey was born at the University of Colorado Hospital at 2:08 this afternoon! His birth mom did great, enduring an induction, and when that didn&rsquo;t work, an emergency c-section. Oliver did great too &mdash; his Apgars were 8 and 8. We were able to go to the hospital to meet him a little after 6:00. When we got there, Oliver was sleeping peacefully in his birth grandma&rsquo;s arms. Together, she and I admired his perfect little ears, his sweet little mouth, his beautiful little nose. I held him, and then Rebecca held him. We were so excited to finally meet him!</p>

<p>The hospital staff were very nice, and found us a room on the maternity floor where we could care for Oliver overnight. Our nurse, Stephanie, showed me how to breastfeed him. Because I don&rsquo;t have a full milk supply, she also helped us use a supplemental nurser with the breast milk (colostrum, actually) that we&rsquo;d bought from the milk bank a few days before.</p>

<p>Rebecca and I crammed into the tiny hospital bed together, and Oliver slept in his hospital crib right next to our bed. The nurse told us to wake him every three hours to feed him, so three hours after his first feeding, we tried and tried to wake him, but he was way too sleepy. We called Stephanie in and she tried unsuccessfully to wake him too, and then told us that it was all right to wait another hour or so to feed him. We did, and by then he was ready.</p>

<p>Although Oliver only opened his eyes once or twice overnight, we were amazed by how good his head control was. When we laid him face-down on one of our chests, he often lifted up his head.</p>

<p>Once during the night, the nurse came by because Oliver&rsquo;s monitoring device had fallen off his leg; this completely shut down all the elevators in that part of the hospital to prevent any newborn babies from being snatched. We soon found the device and reattached it to his leg.</p>

<p>Oliver woke and cried a few times in the night, and we were able to calm him fairly easily, even though we didn&rsquo;t know him very well yet. He was still pretty sleepy from his big day. Being born is exhausting!</p>
